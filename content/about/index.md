Hello! I'm William, a software developer engineer based in Brazil (working from home) and a Ph.D. student.

I like to develop softwares, mainly that involve systems inside companies like sites, applications and mobile applications. I help companies consulting and developing systems, focusing on optimization and integration.

In the middle of my Bs.C. from [Univates](https://www.univates.br/), I joined as co-operate in [SOLIS](https://www.solis.com.br), working in projects for academic institutions and training small teams around Brazil (visited 12 states). Shortly after graduating, I began an MBA course on [UCS](https://www.ucs.br) focusing on Project Management in Software as I stopped near in the end due to be selected on Ms.C. at [UFRGS](http://www.ufrgs.br). In this time I started working as Consultant and Software developer. Now, I'm working on my Ph.D. thesis that focus on solving scheduling, allocating and rostering problems. Also I work as consultant and Software Engineer.

Here are a few technologies I've been working with recently:
